By review of the chart, it appears that she fell, which is what she states when she got up out of a rocking chair and could not get herself off the floor.  She states that 1-1/2 hours later she was able to get herself off the floor.,The patient denies any chest pain nor clear shortness of breath.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Includes, end-stage renal disease from hypertension.  She follows up with Dr. X in her office and has been known to have a small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion since 11/07 that has apparently been followed and it appears that the patient was not interested in having diagnostic pericardiocentesis done.  She had an echocardiogram today (please see also that report), which shows stable and small-to-moderate sized pericardial effusion without tamponade, normal left ventricular ejection fraction at 55% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated right ventricular size, normal right ventricular ejection fraction, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary hypertension, estimated PA systolic pressure of 71 mmHg when compared to the prior echocardiogram done 08/29/07, previously the mitral regurgitation was mild and previously the PA systolic pressure was estimated at 90 mmHg.

Height is 5 feet 1 inch, weight 147 pounds.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who does arouse to voice, but then becomes quite sleepy and apparently that is an improvement from when she was admitted.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are difficult to assess, but do not appear clinically distended.  No carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2 regular rate, 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard with radiation from the left apex towards the left axilla.  No rub, no gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  CVA is benign.  Extremities with no significant edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  She has evidence of right upper extremity edema, which is apparently chronic.,DIAGNOSTIC DATA/LAB DATA: , EKGs are reviewed including from 07/07/09 at 08:31 a.m., which shows atrial fibrillation with left anterior fascicular block, poor R-wave progression when compared to one done on 07/06/09 at 18:25, there is really no significant change.  The atrial fibrillation appears present since at least on EKG done on 11/02/07 and this EKG is not significantly changed from the most recent one.  Echocardiogram results as above.  Chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  BNP shows 3788.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.5, chloride 94, bicarbonate 23, BUN 49, creatinine 5.90.  Troponin was 0.40 followed by 0.34.  INR 1.03 on 05/18/07.  White blood cell count 9.4, hematocrit 42, platelet count 139.,IMPRESSION: , Ms. ABC is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia, so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time.  She does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and I found an EKG report by Dr. X, which shows atrial fibrillation on 08/29/07 per her report.  One of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for Coumadin.  Clearly given her history of small mini-strokes, I think Coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation, but the main issue is the fall risk.  If not felt to be significant fall risk then I would strongly recommend Coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year.  I would defer that decision to Dr. Z and Dr. XY who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Fall assessment as per Dr. Z and Dr. XY with possible PT consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk, would put her on Coumadin.  Given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation, she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.,2.  The patient has elevated BNP and I suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal LV function, I would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis.,3.  Regarding this minimal troponin elevation, I do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her small-to-moderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what I can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade.  I would defer to her usual cardiologist Dr. X whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification.  I did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 08/07 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall, but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal LV function seen on that study as well.,4.  Continue Norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol.,5.  The patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary CVA, thromboprophylaxis (albeit understanding that it is inferior to Coumadin).,6.  Continue Dilantin for history of seizures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cardiovascular / Pulmonary"}]}

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gastroenterology"}]}

Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,This 74-year-old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra.  The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula.  Recommendation for a surgery was made.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.  They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.  All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic.  An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.  The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall.  At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad.  The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.  The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.  At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess.  When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus.  The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.  At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum.  At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed.  Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired.  The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.  Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.  A pursestring device was fired.  The staple line was cut.  The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied.  At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced.  The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.  ,Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom.  It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches.  Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.  No air was seen evolving from the staple line.  All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.  The scope was removed at this point.  The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.  Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.  After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again.  More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.  The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin.  The wire was passed under the transverse colon.  It was left in place.  Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis.  At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied.  Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.  Copious amount of irrigation was used.  The skin was approximated with staples.  At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made.  The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.  One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened.  As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well.  At this point, dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.

He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure.  He was stable at that time.  He did complain of some nausea.  However, he did not have any vomiting at that time.  He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o.  He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol.  On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed.  Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows.  He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications.  He ambulated frequently.  He remained n.p.o. for three days.  He also had the NG tube in during that time.  On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued.

Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.,2.  Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:  ,The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.,The lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gastroenterology"}]}

The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.

General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  The neck was prepped as well.  After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.  I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap.  A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.  The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well.  There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neurology"}]}

The right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity.  The right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity.  The right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent.  The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing.  The distal amplitude was very reduced, and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation.  The right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow.  The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee.  The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency.  The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing.  The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency.  The minimum F-wave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency as indicated above.  With repetitive nerve stimulation, there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles.  Concentric needle EMG studies were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue.  There was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue.  In addition, there was evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above.,INTERPRETATION: , Abnormal electrodiagnostic study.  There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments.  There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities.  There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.  Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory responses is concerning, and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.  However, the overall changes on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease.

She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.  The ureteroscope was then removed.  The cystoscope was reinserted.  Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system.  No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized.  The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system.  The cystoscope was removed.  Foley catheter was inserted.  The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Surgery"}]}

The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time.  The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness.  She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Surgery"}]}

The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Surgery"}]}

Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Surgery"}]}
