𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗲'𝘀 𝗔𝗜 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗽𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗲?

because we're just lazy prompt engineers, 

low-context prompt force AI to default to most generic world it can think of, based on the most common patterns in it's training data

prompting is not instruction anymore, it's all about world building, the more pieces of the puzzle you provide, the more AI can fill in a world that matched your vision

here, World Builder's tool kit!

1. 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀, 
Command AI to break down large, intimidating numbers or concepts into their fundamental components. this allows you to question assumptions and see possibilities and others miss

2. 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 
Instead of asking for a simple summary, prompt for specific types of insights. Ask for the 'Red pill' concepts, the ideas that are counter intuitive or that's highlights in the content and actionable plan from the content as well


3. 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 & 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 
Reduce hallucination by setting firm boundaries. Demand that the AI model when it doesn't know something and quantify it's certainty for the information it does provide 

Most models are often designed to be agreeable. asking for a confidence score forces a more objective self-assessment of it's own output!

4. 𝗘𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 & 𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝘂𝗲𝘀
A research paper found that telling an AI to 'take a deep breath' caused it's scores on math tests to increase. This is because emotional and memory centers are linked to the human psychology in the AI's training data.

this prompting style is very useful when there is need of thinking and reasoning steps involved

5. 𝗦𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗰𝗿𝘆
Erase the generic 'LLM writing' styles by combining prohibitive rules with the positive example 

feed the AI system a collection of your own writing and instruct it 'write in the style of the provided text examples'


Sorry, prompt engineers, I underestimated you. Only after doing the work did I realise you're more than just developers.
